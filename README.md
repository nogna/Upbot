This was made as a bachelor project. 

Being able to access information from process monitoring systems
mobile is a great advantage. Today there are several solutions to this,
for example using email or applications. However, these solutions are
not always optimal since applications require active development and
emails are not always as flexible as one would wish. We have therefore
developed a software extension that will allow systems to publish
information about state changes from processes on already existing
social networking services.
In this project we have chosen to cooperate with GE Healthcare to develop
an extension to their software UNICORN which is used for monitoring
and controlling of protein purification processes. The extension
is currently developed towards Twitter but may in the future be developed
so that it also works with other social networking services, such
as Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat. Through our extension, users of
UNICORN can take part of events from a process directly through Twitter.
